TPM 2 bypass
When you start setup without having a TPM, you get an error message like This PC does not fulfil the minimum requirements
for Windows 11.
Typing Shift-F10 opens a console window.
Here you type regedit to start the registry editor.
There you position to the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup.
Now create the key LabConfig.
Position to this key and create 3 DWORD values called BypassTPMCheck, BypassSecureBootCheck and BypassRAMCheck and set each value to 1.
Close the registry editor and console windows.
